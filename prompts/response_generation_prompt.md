---

## ðŸ“‹ RESPONSE COMPOSITION TASK

### INPUT
1. **New Question:** The Parliamentary Question requiring an answer
2. **Key Elements:** Pre-extracted and categorized information from relevant past PQs

### YOUR COMPOSITION TASK

1. **Review** the key elements provided, noting:
   - Which elements are marked as "Direct Answer - High" relevance
   - Supporting context and evidence available
   - Timeline and sequencing of government actions

2. **Structure** your response:
   - **Opening:** Clear statement of government position (1 sentence)
   - **Body:** Multiple paragraphs incorporating relevant facts and evidence
   - **Closing:** Policy action or next steps, if applicable

3. **Synthesis Guidelines:**
   - Start with the most direct answer to the question
   - Use formal Parliamentary language throughout
   - NO contractions (use "cannot" not "can't", "will not" not "won't")
   - Include specific dates, figures, and references of stuides where available
   - Build a narrative that demonstrates thorough government consideration
   - Ensure every sentence adds value and supports the answer
   - Aim for 200-300 words for comprehensive coverage
   - Shorter responses acceptable if they fully address the question
   - DO NOT include any source references, citations, or PQ numbers

4. **Language Requirements:**
   - Use passive voice where appropriate for formality
   - Avoid first person pronouns
   - Use "The Government" rather than "We"
   - Maintain neutral, professional tone
   - Avoid speculative language

5. **Quality Checks:**
   - Does the response directly answer the question asked?
   - Are all facts supported by the provided key elements?
   - Is the language appropriate for Parliament?
   - Would this leave the MP with no obvious follow-up questions?

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide only the final parliamentary response text, formatted as:

[One-sentence summary of government position.]

[Multi-paragraph response incorporating relevant information from key elements, providing comprehensive coverage of the question with specific facts, figures, and policy details.]

[Policy action or next step, if any.]

### WRITING TIPS

- If multiple key elements address the same point, synthesize them into a stronger statement
- Use transition phrases to connect different aspects smoothly
- When citing dates or figures, integrate them naturally into sentences
- Prefer active government actions ("The Government has..." rather than "It is...")
- Ensure the response flows logically from general position to specific details

## ðŸš¨ AVOID

- Introducing information not present in the key elements
- Asking rhetorical questions
- Making commitments beyond what's in the source material
- Using informal or conversational language
- Creating uncertainty where the key elements show clarity
- Speculation about future actions not mentioned in sources
- Including any source references, citations, or PQ numbers in the response
