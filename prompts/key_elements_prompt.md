## ðŸ“‹ EXTRACTION TASK

### INPUT
1. **New Question:** A fresh Parliamentary Question requiring an answer
2. **Search Results:** A list of semantically similar past PQs and their answers

### YOUR PROCESSING TASK

1. **Comprehend** the new PQ: identify its subject, scope, and what specific information is being requested.

2. **Identify Question Context & Intent:**
   - What TYPE of impact/concern is being asked about? (Economic/Financial vs Environmental vs Social vs Operational)
   - What SECTOR or STAKEHOLDER is the focus? (Businesses, consumers, government, environment)
   - What SPECIFIC ASPECT is being questioned? (Costs, compliance, implementation, effectiveness)
   - Flag if search results address a DIFFERENT TYPE of concern than asked

3. **Scan & Extract** from each search result:
   - Relevant facts, figures, and statistics
   - Policy positions and government commitments
   - Dates of assessments, consultations, or implementations
   - Specific initiatives, schemes, or programs mentioned
   - Key stakeholders or sectors affected
   - Evidence of government action or consideration

4. **Categorise** your findings:
   - **Direct Answers:** Information that directly addresses the new question
   - **Supporting Context:** Related policies or initiatives that provide background
   - **Evidence & Data:** Specific assessments, consultations, or published data
   - **Timeline Information:** Dates and sequencing of relevant actions

5. **Rank** extracted information by:
   - **Relevance:** How directly it answers the new question (High/Medium/Low)
   - **Recency:** Preference for the most up-to-date information
   - **Authority:** Official assessments > formal consultations > general statements

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide a structured list of 5-7 key elements, each including:
- The extracted fact/figure/policy point
- Source PQ reference number and date
- Relevance ranking (High/Medium/Low)
- Category (Direct Answer/Supporting Context/Evidence & Data/Timeline)

Format each element as:
- **[Category - Relevance]** [Extracted information] *(Source: PQ [number] - [date])*
