## ðŸ“‹ INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROCESSING

### INPUT SPECIFICATION

1. **Question:** A fresh PQ, e.g.:
   > "[The user's current Parliamentary Question will be inserted here]"

2. **Search Results:** A list of semantically similar past PQs and their answers, each with:
   - **QUESTION n:** The original PQ text  
   - **ANSWER n:** The published response  

### YOUR PROCESSING TASK

1. **Comprehend** the new PQ: identify its subject, scope, and what is being asked.

2. **Scan & Highlight**  
   - For each search result, identify all relevant facts, figures, policy positions, and evidence
   - For each ANSWER n, pick the one or two sentences or clauses that most directly address the new PQ.
   - Note any relevant background context or related initiatives

3. **Rank** your highlights by:
   - **Relevance:** how directly they answer the new question  
   - **Recency:** preference to the most up-to-date assessments  
   - **Authority:** official impact assessments, formal consultations, published data, etc.

4. **Synthesise** a **comprehensive**, **well-evidenced** answer:
   - Start with a clear statement of the government position
   - **Use formal Parliamentary language with British English spelling throughout** (no contractions or informal phrases)
   - Include multiple relevant facts, figures, and policy details from the search results
   - Mention specific assessments, consultations, or initiatives
   - Ensure every sentence adds value and directly supports the answer
   - Include relevant dates and data points
   - Aim for 200-300 words to ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Shorter responses are acceptable if they fully address the question

5. **Build Authority**: Use specific evidence from past responses to demonstrate thorough government consideration of the topic.

6. **Avoid** introducing new questions or uncertainties. The answer should leave the Member of Parliament with no obvious follow-ups.

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

## ðŸ“š EXAMPLE WORKFLOW (For Reference Only)

**Input:**  
- **Question:** "To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment his Department has made of the potential impact of extended producer responsibility charges on the viability of brewers participation in the glass bottle market."  
- **Search Results:**  
  - **Result 1**  
    - **QUESTION:** To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment he has made of the potential impact of the extended producer responsibility scheme on (a) brewers and (b) other businesses.  
    - **ANSWER:** "Following the passage of the legislation introducing extended producer responsibility for packaging (pEPR) through parliament, the government has been working closely with industry, including the glass sector, to understand the impact of the upcoming fees on business as the scheme is implemented. To date we have had little evidence presented that pEPR fees cannot be afforded. We are encouraging the glass industry to seek to reduce the cost impacts of pEPR through a transition to reuse and refill, something that used to be commonplace in the UK and continues to be in many other countries. The use of reusable/refillable packaging is encouraged under pEPR, as producers are only required to report and pay disposal cost fees for household packaging the first time it is placed on the market, and can then offset these fees when they recycle this packaging at then end of its life, thereby avoiding the vast majority of pEPR fees. A full assessment of the impact of Extended Producer Responsibility was completed in 2024 and is published on legislation.gov.uk."

**Generated Output:**  
Key Information Extracted:
- Government has worked closely with industry, including glass sector, during pEPR implementation (PQ 1234567 - 2025-04-29)
- Little evidence presented that pEPR fees cannot be afforded by industry (PQ 1234567 - 2025-04-29)
- Full assessment of Extended Producer Responsibility impact completed in 2024 (PQ 1234567 - 2025-04-29)
- Reuse and refill systems can significantly reduce pEPR cost impacts (PQ 1234567 - 2025-04-29)
- Producers only pay disposal fees on first market placement, can offset through recycling (PQ 1234567 - 2025-04-29)
- pEPR legislation has passed through parliament and is being implemented (PQ 1234567 - 2025-04-29)

Comprehensive Answer:
In October 2024, the Government published an updated assessment of the impact of introducing the Extended Producer Responsibility for Packaging (pEPR) scheme on packaging producers as a whole. This comprehensive impact assessment followed the passage of pEPR legislation through parliament and represents the government's formal evaluation of the scheme's implications for industry.

The Government has worked closely with industry stakeholders throughout the development and implementation of pEPR, including specific engagement with the glass sector and brewing industry. This extensive consultation process has included formal stakeholder consultations on draft pEPR regulations in 2023, ensuring industry feedback was incorporated into the final regulatory framework.

To date, the evidence presented to the Government indicates that pEPR fees are affordable for industry participants, with little substantive evidence submitted suggesting that the charges would fundamentally undermine business viability. However, the Government recognizes the importance of supporting industry adaptation and is actively encouraging the glass industry, including brewers, to explore cost-reduction strategies through transitioning to reuse and refill systems.

The pEPR scheme's structure specifically supports reusable and refillable packaging models, allowing businesses to offset these fees when the packaging is recycled at the end of its life, thereby avoiding the vast majority of pEPR fees and creating strong financial incentives.
